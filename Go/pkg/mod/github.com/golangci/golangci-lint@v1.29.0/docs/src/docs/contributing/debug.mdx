You can see a verbose output of linter by using `-v` option.

If you would like to see more detailed logs you can set environment variable `GL_DEBUG` to debug `golangci-lint`.
It's value is a list of debug tags. For example, `GL_DEBUG=loader,gocritic golangci-lint run`.
Existing debug tags:

1. `gocritic` - debug `go-critic` linter;
2. `env` - debug `go env` command;
3. `loader` - debug packages loading (including `go/packages` internal debugging);
4. `autogen_exclude` - debug a filter excluding autogenerated source code;
5. `nolint` - debug a filter excluding issues by `//nolint` comments.
