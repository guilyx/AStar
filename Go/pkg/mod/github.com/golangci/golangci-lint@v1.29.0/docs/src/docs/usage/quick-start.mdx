To run golangci-lint execute:

```sh
golangci-lint run
```

It's an equivalent of executing:

```sh
golangci-lint run ./...
```

You can choose which directories and files to analyze:

```sh
golangci-lint run dir1 dir2/... dir3/file1.go
```

Directories are NOT analyzed recursively. To analyze them recursively append `/...` to their path.

GolangCI-Lint can be used with zero configuration. By default the following linters are enabled:

```sh
$ golangci-lint help linters
{.LintersCommandOutputEnabledOnly}
```

and the following linters are disabled by default:

```sh
$ golangci-lint help linters
...
{.LintersCommandOutputDisabledOnly}
```

Pass `-E/--enable` to enable linter and `-D/--disable` to disable:

```sh
golangci-lint run --disable-all -E errcheck
```
