title: Website architecture
---

## Technology

We use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for static site generation because sites built with it
are very fast.

This framework uses React and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Source Code

The website lives in `docs/` directory of [golangci-lint repository](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).

## Theme

Initially the site is based on [@rocketseat](https://rocketdocs.netlify.app/) theme.
Later we've merged it's code into `src/@rocketseat` because we needed too much changes
and [gatsby shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) doesn't
allow shadowing `gatsby-node.js` or `gatsby-config.js`.

## Navigation

Left menu is configured in `src/config/sidebar.yml`.

## Articles

Articles are located in `src/docs/` in `*.mdx` files. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby) is markdown
allowing to use `React` components.

## Templating

We use templates like `{.SomeField}` inside our `mdx` files. There templates are expanded
by running `make expand_website_templates` in the root of the repository.
It runs script `scripts/expand_website_templates/main.go` that rewrites `mdx` files with replaced templates.

## CDN and DNS

We use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for CDN, proxying and DNS management.

## Hosting

We use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as static website hosting and CD.
It's integrated into our pull requests: if `docs/` directory has changes Netlify
will trigger website rebuild and deploy it's preview for a branch. You can view
it to ensure that everything ok.

Netlify deploys the website to production after merging anything to a `master` branch.

## Local Testing

Run:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000` after successfull Gatsby build.
There is no need to restart Gatsby server almost for all changes: it supports hot reload.
Also, there is no need to refresh a webpage: hot reload updates changed content on the open page.

## Trigger Website Rebuild

Currently, Netlify triggers rebuild only if anything has changes in `docs/` directory.
But we can add a new linter and need to change a documentation to list the linter.

To do it run

```sh
go run ./scripts/expand_website_templates/main.go -only-state
```

It saves a hash of template replacements (that include all linters, configs, etc)
into `docs/template_data.state`.
