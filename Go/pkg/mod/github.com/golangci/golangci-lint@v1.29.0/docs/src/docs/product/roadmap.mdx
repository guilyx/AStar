## Future Plans

1. Upstream all changes of forked linters.
2. Make it easy to write own linter/checker: it should take a minimum code, have perfect documentation, debugging and testing tooling.
3. Speed up SSA loading: on-disk cache and existing code profiling-optimizing.
4. Analyze (don't only filter) only new code: analyze only changed files and dependencies, make incremental analysis, caches.
5. Smart new issues detector: don't print existing issues on changed lines.
6. Minimize false-positives by fixing linters and improving testing tooling.
7. Automatic issues fixing (code rewrite, refactoring) where it's possible.
8. Documentation for every issue type.
